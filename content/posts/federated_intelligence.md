Stage one is massive grounding in physics and human family relationships. This is self supervised. These are the foundational embeddings.

Stage 2 is the beginning of symbolic learning, where humans begin to compress and relate embeddings using symbols. A hierarchy of representations begin to form. This both self supervised and supervised.

Stage 3 is the 12+ years of transfer learning called school. Where the multi-tiered symbolic embedding space of collective human knowledge is distilled into the developing human. This is supervised.

Stage 4 is agent participation in the game of life. Learning and teaching. This is self supervised and supervised.

Human intelligence is a federated model.
